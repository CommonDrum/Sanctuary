# Sanctuary
Store, find, and connect your ideas using private AI assistance. Everything stays on your computer.

The main premise behind this plugin is to ask quick questions about your notes or code to a locally running LLM. Did you forget how to implement a tool or some boilerplate, but you already wrote this down somewhere or it's in one of these files? Ask a helper who knows your notes better than you. 

## Requirements
- You have to have ollama installed and running when using the plugin.
- Install requirements.txt for python. 

## Notice

This is a hobby project and I'm still figuring stuff out so have patience.
